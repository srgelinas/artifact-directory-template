Title:
Graph-Based Deep Learning for Fraud Detection in Ethereum Transaction Networks

Abstract:
Blockchain technology is a quickly growing field, helped greatly through
its widespread applications in the financial field. However, the space has
been under attack through phishing fraud, posing itself as a major threat
to blockchain security. According to the FTC, cryptocurrency scams have
cost online users over $1 Billion since 2021; there is a clear demand for
the development of effective fraud detection strategies to prevent and
detect cybercrimes. With access to Ethereum transaction networks, we
can model and train phishing detection as a node classification problem.
With graph-based machine learning approaches, we can more effectively
flag fraudulent activity in Ethereum networks and reduce the amount of
phishing activity with Ethereum, and improve user experience with safer
transactions as blockchain technology gains even more traction.
